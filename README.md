# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project was based on an asphalt project that reqiured us to create a mural of something using grids on Code.org. I chose to use Steve because Minecraft has been a huge part of my life and it still is today where Steve brings back all of the nostalgia from back then.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - One thing I am proud of in my project is being able to create my own while loops that genuinely have a purpose to the code. I am also proud of my mural as it turned out pretty good.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I would improve on or do differently next time is to challenge myself further by using a larger grid as I only used a 12 x 12. Maybe next time I can use a 32 x 32 grid.
